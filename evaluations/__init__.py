Evaluation framework for comparing agentic vs LLM guest simulation systems.

This module provides metrics and analysis tools for ablation studies across:
- Experiment 1: LLM baseline (no agents/tools)
- Experiment 2: Main Agent + Order Tracking Agent
- Experiment 3: Main Agent + Order Tracking + Behavioral Control
- Experiment 4: Full system with Exit Gating
