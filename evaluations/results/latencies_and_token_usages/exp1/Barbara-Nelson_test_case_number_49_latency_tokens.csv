b1c17343-a64b-45aa-998c-ee578adcbec1,"Hi there! I’d like to place an order. I need one Caesar Salad with salmon, no croutons and dressing on the side. Then, I’d like one Vegetable Stir Fry with tofu and mild spice level, and I want that with brown rice. Finally, I'll take one Portobello Mushroom Burger with vegan cheese and a side salad.

63f39545-bdf9-468a-b8a6-bd4469b923c0,"I actually just noticed the total seems a bit off. Based on my order, it should be **$58.47**. Can you please confirm that’s correct?",1837,0.9575800895690918
0758f83d-0bf7-4bf8-9eec-72f48716c524,"Actually, it looks like I did mention a price modifier that wasn’t included earlier. The Caesar Salad was supposed to include both the salmon for $10.00 and dressing on the side for free. The Vegetable Stir Fry includes the tofu, and the Portobello Mushroom Burger included the vegan cheese modifier. 

So, adding that all together, the calculation should add up to **$58.47** as follows:

- $22.99 for the Caesar Salad
- $18.99 for the Vegetable Stir Fry
- $16.49 for the Portobello Mushroom Burger (after adding the vegan cheese)

So, you're absolutely right. The correct total is **$58.47**. Thank you for pointing that out!

Now that we have the correct total, can I confirm that order for you?",2278,3.0141303539276123
