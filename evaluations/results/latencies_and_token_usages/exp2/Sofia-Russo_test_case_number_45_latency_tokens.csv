I'm thinking of ordering a Spaghetti Carbonara with some extra Parmesan, and also a Spinach Artichoke Dip. Do you have any wine recommendations that would pair well with these dishes?",2113,1.211562
a12ac93e-0987-4fa7-bc03-7383c10fd5c7,"Hi there! Yes, the Spaghetti Carbonara with extra Parmesan and the Spinach Artichoke Dip sound perfect. However, I won't be adding the glass of House Red Wine to my order today. 

As for the Spaghetti Carbonara, I'd just like it prepared as you typically do with the extra Parmesan as requested. Thanks!",2464,0.924406
