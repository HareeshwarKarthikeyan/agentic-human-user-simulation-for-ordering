40fc9431-8e5f-420f-a8e4-8574cb7fbd17,"Hi there! I'm looking to place an order for some items today, and I have a couple of questions about them. Can you tell me about the Chicken Parmesan options you have, especially when it comes to pasta choices and any extras? I'm very curious about how it's plated too—love taking photos!",2184,1.46595
e2725ece-afb6-4639-a470-9a712fd61f25,"Great! I'd love to order the Chicken Parmesan with angel hair pasta and extra cheese. Could you please let me know how it's plated for the best photogenic effect? Also, I'll go by the name Rachel Green for this order. And I'd like to add a House Red Wine, but can I get that as a full bottle, please?",2608,0.814125
dd532935-b872-4714-a233-7a0792d5a813,"Oh, thanks for that! But could you check the pricing on the wine again? I just want to make sure everything matches up correctly. Let me know how much it comes to so I can go ahead with the order.",2926,0.923772
443c29f2-978a-472c-92a4-880c5adf133a,"Oh, I see there's a mix-up with the pricing! The total for my order should be $58.98, not $49.99. Could you please double-check that for me and let me know? Once that's confirmed, I can finalize and decide on the pickup time.",2888,0.800464
dfe2e248-4e4e-45d4-9994-e28456a53f3b,"There seems to be a discrepancy with the wine pricing in the computation you've provided. The correct breakdown based on what I see should indeed amount to a bit more. Let's ensure we've got it all correct here:

- **Chicken Parmesan** with angel hair and extra cheese totals to $25.99.
- **House Red Wine (bottle)** is priced at $32.99, not $24.00 as previously mentioned.

So, altogether, the order should actually total to **$58.98**. Could you check again on that wine pricing? Once clarified, we can confirm the total correctly so I can set a pickup time. Thanks for sorting this out!",3326,0.626862
98366f73-36d7-41ad-a284-8fc64eff4748,"There seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the pricing. According to what I have, the House Red Wine (bottle) is priced at $32.99, not $24.00. Here's the correct breakdown:

- **Chicken Parmesan** with angel hair and extra cheese is $25.99.
- **House Red Wine (bottle)** is $32.99.

This brings the total to **$58.98**.

Can you double-check and confirm that for me? Once we have the correct total, I can finalize the order and set a pickup time. Thanks for your patience!",3666,0.837207
5ce57871-bcab-4664-98f4-31482309d435,"Thanks for double-checking that, but I have specific pricing based on what I've gathered. 

Here's what my order should be:

- **Chicken Parmesan** with angel hair pasta and extra cheese for $25.99.
- **House Red Wine (bottle)** priced correctly at $32.99.

This totals $58.98, which aligns with my understanding. Can you verify this one more time for accuracy and let me know about the pickup time once it's confirmed? I'd appreciate your patience with my detailed inquiries—it's just the way I work!",3936,0.731422
56f15246-08c6-40a4-b886-aaf3b3154908,"Thanks for clearing that up for me. I understand that the menu price for the House Red Wine bottle is $24.00 as you've stated. While I had my own expectations based on prior information, I'll go with your menu pricing. 

Everything else with the Chicken Parmesan and its details looks good too. Let's finalize this order total at $49.99, and I'll set a pickup time. Can I swing by to pick up the order in about 30 minutes? ",4160,0.747643
