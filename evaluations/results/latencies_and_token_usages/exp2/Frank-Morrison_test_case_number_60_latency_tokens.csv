Could you help me out by placing an order for a Classic Burger cooked well done with American cheese and French fries, a Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a Fruit Cup, and two small Fresh Orange Juices?",2304,1.227973
8e7cbb20-33c5-420e-9664-3b24585bb54f,"No thanks, we don't need any dipping sauces for the chicken sandwich. Everything else sounds great! Can you let me know the total price?",2596,2.266254
deec5e3d-3a7c-46c2-81fa-946d388c5321,"Oh, it seems there might be a little confusion with the total price. Could we double-check that? I have the Classic Burger with well-done meat, American cheese, and French fries going for $17.49, the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a fruit cup for $16.99, and the two small Fresh Orange Juices totaling $11.98. That should bring us to $46.46.

And sure, for the order, you can use the last name ""Morrison."" We can pick it up in 20 minutes. Thanks!",2940,0.709359
