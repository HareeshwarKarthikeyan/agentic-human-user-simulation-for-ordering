5642ebbf-3083-4f6c-875c-715c5c8e5a7c,Hi there! I'd like to place an order for a Portobello Mushroom Burger with vegan cheese. Can I also have sweet potato fries as the side? Could you tell me a bit about how the burger is prepared? I just want to make sure everything is fully plant-based with no cross-contamination. Thanks!,2124,1.258746

d9e5a9a9-1fd1-43ae-b2c2-32be7998f319,"It looks like there's a slight discrepancy in the total price. I believe the burger with vegan cheese and sweet potato fries should total $18.49, according to my understanding. Could you please double-check that for me? ",2467,0.655056
9e3081ad-fda8-4a02-b170-2d3d1562fcb4,"Ah, I appreciate the clarification, but I actually meant for the total to include the $2.50 for the vegan cheese. So, it should come to $18.49 with everything added.

I'm good with my order as it is, thank you! The Portobello Mushroom Burger with vegan cheese and sweet potato fries is all I need. Just ensuring it is all completely plant-based with no animal product involvement.

No need for a drink or dessert today, but thanks for the suggestion!",2682,0.738421
