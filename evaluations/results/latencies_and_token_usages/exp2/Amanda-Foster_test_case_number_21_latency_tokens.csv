My order includes two large Margherita Pizzas and three Caesar Salads, which should total $88.95 based on my expectation, possibly including the charge for the large size or any tax estimates.

Let's make sure all price components and size charges are considered in your total adjustment. Could you provide a breakdown for the large size and any taxes or additional charges that may apply? Thank you!",2914,0.824241

- **Large Margherita Pizza (2)** with size upgrade: $24.99 each, totaling **$49.98**  
- **Caesar Salad (3)**: $12.99 each, totaling **$38.97**
