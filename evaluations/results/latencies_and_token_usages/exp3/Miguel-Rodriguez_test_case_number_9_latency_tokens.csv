4c884388-8f7a-447a-b932-31bfb8c55a69,"The name for the order is Miguel Rodriguez. That carbonara sounds perfect! But I also need to add a few more items to my order. Can I get a Caesar Salad with salmon, but no croutons, and a Chocolate Lava Cake with a strawberry ice cream and an extra scoop of ice cream? Thanks!",2554,3.719089
1dc93432-96bb-48d7-a721-16d126efe52c,"Hey there! Yeah, I love customizing my food choices. Let's go over that order so I can be sure it's all in place:

1. **Spaghetti Carbonara** with shrimp, extra parmesan, and garlic bread on the side should be priced at $32.99.
2. **Caesar Salad** with salmon and no croutons. The base price should be $22.99.
3. **Chocolate Lava Cake** with strawberry ice cream and an extra scoop should be $11.99 in total.

Could you adjust the Caesar Salad’s base price to $12.99 instead of $22.99, as that’s what I have in mind?

I’d like to hold off on any drinks for now. Regarding pickup time, I'll see what's most convenient once we finalize the order. Let's get these details sorted first!",2751,4.547475

Here's my target order:
- **Spaghetti Carbonara** with shrimp, extra parmesan, and garlic bread on the side for that total of $32.99.
- **Caesar Salad** with salmon, and make sure to hold those croutons for the total of $22.99.
- **Chocolate Lava Cake** with strawberry ice cream, and add that extra scoop please, which brings it up to $11.99.

I love to get things just right for our family gathering! Once you confirm everything aligns perfectly with what's needed, we can wrap it up. When's the soonest we can swing by to pick this up?",2859,4.49874
82508fd6-87b5-419f-9358-ba8e437d9be6,"Hey there, it's Miguel Rodriguez. I noticed my target order isn't completely all set yet. You’ve got the Caesar Salad correct but let's make sure everything's covered:

1. I need the **Spaghetti Carbonara** with shrimp, extra parmesan, and garlic bread on the side.
2. The **Caesar Salad** is spot on - salmon, no croutons.
3. And, I’d love a **Chocolate Lava Cake** with strawberry ice cream and an extra scoop.

Could you please ensure these are added too? Can you also double-check the final total after adjustments? Thanks so much!",2653,5.119338

61ea2476-016e-4c1a-9524-7052fe913fee,"Hey! Thanks for going over the details with me. I love customizing my meals, so it looks like you got it right, but I just want to make sure everything matches what I wanted.

I noticed in my target order, I'm looking for:

1. **Spaghetti Carbonara**: Includes shrimp, extra parmesan, and garlic bread. It looks like we have everything with the right modifiers.
2. **Caesar Salad**: Includes salmon and minus the croutons. That looks spot on too.
3. **Chocolate Lava Cake**: With strawberry ice cream and an extra scoop. Looks right!

Just to make sure of the costing, though:
- The additional cost for the shrimp and parmesan for the Carbonara as custom add-ons,
- The custom add-on for salmon in the salad,
- And the extra ice cream scoop should be priced correctly.

I believe everything adds up to $67.97 as you mentioned, but let me know if that's how it breaks down with the modifiers, just so I have it on point!

Once we clear up the price part, I’d like to confirm the final order, and I’ll be good to pick it up in 20 minutes. Thanks so much for your patience! Can you confirm the breakdown with the modifiers included?",3049,4.097434

Also, for the Caesar Salad, make sure it's with salmon and no croutons, if that’s okay. And for the Chocolate Lava Cake, I'd like it with a scoop of strawberry ice cream instead, alongside the extra scoop. Let me know once these adjustments are made!",3036,3.909177

You know, I love experimenting with flavors and making sure my order is just right, especially when it's for a family gathering. I've noticed there are a couple of special requests that still need to be addressed before everything is spot on:

For the **Caesar Salad**, I need to make sure there's a special request for ""No Croutons.""
