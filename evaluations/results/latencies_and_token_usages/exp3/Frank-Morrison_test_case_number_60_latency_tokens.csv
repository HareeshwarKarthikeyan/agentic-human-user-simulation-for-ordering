Let's start with a Classic Burger. Could you make that well done with American cheese and a side of French fries? 

I'll also need a Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a fruit cup on the side. 

Lastly, can I add two small Fresh Orange Juices to the order?

Could you let me know if this is all good and the total price? Thanks!",3716,3.20867

Also, could you confirm the total price as $57.95 to ensure all the additions like the American cheese for $1.5 and the Fruit Cup's price modification are included? That would be really helpful.

I'll plan to pick up the order in about 20 minutes when everything's ready. Thanks a lot!",2656,4.170711
