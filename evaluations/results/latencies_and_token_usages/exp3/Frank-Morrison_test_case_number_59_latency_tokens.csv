I'm interested in ordering a Margherita Pizza in a medium size, some Spaghetti Carbonara, and two servings of Apple Pie served à la mode. Could you provide some details on portion sizes and how kid-friendly these options are?",2142,2.25558
4404555d-1b50-4cff-999c-c473b73c4833,"Ah, thanks a lot! I'm actually just placing this order for my grandkids, and I'm pretty excited for them to try these. It sounds like a good mix for their tastes!

I do have a small adjustment though, just to check in with you. Could you make sure the Margherita Pizza is listed as a ""Medium 14"" for the right size there? Also, just verify those desserts are the traditional delightful Apple Pies with the à la mode option — artistic touch, right?

I won't add any drinks this time, but thank you for asking! As for the name, please put it under ""Frank Morrison.""

Could you confirm those details and prices for me one more time before proceeding? Thanks a bunch!",2695,4.146462
