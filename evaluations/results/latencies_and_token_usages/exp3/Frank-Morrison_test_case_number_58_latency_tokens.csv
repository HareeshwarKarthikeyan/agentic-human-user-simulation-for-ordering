Can you make that with BBQ Sauce and Apple Slices on the side, along with Milk to drink? And could you also tell me a bit about the portion size for that?",2206,2.008178

And by the way, can we add a Kids Mac and Cheese with Bacon Bits, a Fruit Cup on the side, and Apple Juice as the drink as well? Additionally, I'd like to get Fish and Chips for the order.",2356,3.724309
2bfc613f-705b-4a45-869c-a5172ac43970,"Hi, it's Frank here. Looks like there's a little mix-up with the order. 

I need two orders of the **Kids Chicken Tenders** with BBQ sauce, apple slices, and milk to drink. I also have the **Kids Mac and Cheese** with bacon bits, a fruit cup, and apple juice. 

Could you please update the order for two Kids Chicken Tenders instead of one? Also, the regular beer-battered cod for the Fish and Chips is perfect, thank you!

How's everything looking on your end?",2589,3.523873

Just to double-check, could you tell me if there are any recommendations for a dessert option that's kid-friendly? I'd love to know just in case my grandkids are still a bit peckish afterward. But as it stands, the current order looks perfect!

Thank you so much!",2783,3.95071

Could we make sure that the Kids Chicken Tenders are correctly set with the BBQ Sauce, Apple Slices, and Milk? Also, please confirm if the Kids Mac and Cheese includes Bacon Bits as an add-on with a Fruit Cup and Apple Juice. We'll think about dessert after that. Thanks for your patience!",2678,1.941809
