So, can we make those small adjustments? As for the drink, I’m good with what I have. Thanks!",2610,4.352569
b70aac2c-909b-4290-bcaa-d4b808e7d9f1,"Hey, thanks for checking. I noticed we need a couple of adjustments:

1. For the Ribeye Steak, can you make sure it's cooked medium rare?
2. The Caesar Salad should have grilled chicken as an add-on, and please make sure there are no croutons.
3. Can you double-check that the Cappuccino is a large with skim milk?

Let's make sure that total stays at $68.97. Appreciate your help!",4075,7.281029
