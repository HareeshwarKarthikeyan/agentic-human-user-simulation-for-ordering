Could you let me know about the allergen information, especially for the kids' menu items like the Kids Mac and Cheese and Kids Chicken Tenders? I'll also need some details on the side and drink options. 

Oh, and for the adults, I'm thinking about the Fish and Chips and the Portobello Mushroom Burger. Could you share more on those, please?",2330,3.026721
