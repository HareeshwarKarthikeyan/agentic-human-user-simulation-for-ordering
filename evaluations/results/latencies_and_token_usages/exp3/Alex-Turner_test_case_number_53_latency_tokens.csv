However, I noticed there's a small price discrepancy, probably a misunderstanding. The total should be $18.49 including the vegan cheese modifier. Could you confirm that for me?

a03b0441-0a0b-492f-99b7-8627059c96eb,"Hey, thanks for getting back to me. I just want to confirm a few things to make sure everything is right. 

So, I'm looking for the Portobello Mushroom Burger with vegan cheese and sweet potato fries. I noticed there's a little difference in the price you mentioned for the vegan cheese. I believe it should be $2.50 for the vegan cheese topping, according to what I know. 

Anyway, could you make the necessary adjustments? Thank you for noting the cross-contamination concerns too. Once we get everything sorted out, I'll confirm and we can proceed.",3861,5.710922
10482941-35cc-4c48-bf1a-99fe86411b39,"Hey, I noticed something I need to clarify with you.

The Portobello Mushroom Burger with vegan cheese should have the cheese topping at $2.50, but I see it's been marked down to $2.00, which is nice. However, my target order shows the vegan cheese topping as $2.50, and it includes sweet potato fries as a required side, not an add-on. This makes the total for that meal $18.49.

Can we make sure it's all correct according to my target order:

- **Portobello Mushroom Burger with vegan cheese ($13.99 + $2.50)**
- **Sweet Potato Fries (included as a side choice, $2.00)**

Total should be **$18.49** with everything considered for the burger meal.

I appreciate your efforts to ensure no cross-contamination with animal products. Could you please update that for me? Thanks!",2553,3.309456
