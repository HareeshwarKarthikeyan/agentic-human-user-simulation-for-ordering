Could you please help me put in an order? I need to make sure that we have options suitable for my kids, and I'll need some allergen information along the way. Let's start with 2 Kids Chicken Tenders meals. Can you make one with ketchup, apple slices, and apple juice? Thanks!",3325,2.507735
9d2ebe03-1a21-4ebb-af05-3ae1a419ae60,"For the second Kids Chicken Tenders meal, let's go with ketchup for the sauce, apple slices for the side, and apple juice for the drink — just like the first one.  Could you also add a Classic Burger, cooked medium well, with cheddar cheese, on a gluten-free bun, and a side salad? Plus, a Grilled Chicken Sandwich with avocado and a fruit cup, please.

1. **Kids Chicken Tenders Meal #1**: With ketchup, apple slices, and apple juice.
2. **Kids Chicken Tenders Meal #2**: Same as the first with ketchup, apple slices, and apple juice.
3. **Classic Burger**: Cooked medium well, with cheddar cheese on a gluten-free bun, and a side salad.
4. **Grilled Chicken Sandwich**: With avocado and a fruit cup.

Could you please go ahead and add these to the order? Let me know once that's done. Thanks!",2824,3.915247

Can we make that change? Also, I want to confirm the modifications on the Classic Burger as Cheddar cheese, gluten-free bun, and medium well done.

Could you check this for me and then let me know the updated total?",5381,9.451923
c6f9c5bb-71cd-406f-8759-a4b19df8e089,"Hey, it's David Thompson calling. Thanks for the breakdown, but it looks like we need to make a few adjustments to the order.

Here’s what I actually need, so let's update this together:

1. **Kids Chicken Tenders** - I need just **2 meals** each with ketchup, apple slices, and apple juice.
   
2. **Classic Burger** - That should be with cheddar cheese (and I’ve noticed there's an extra charge for that), on a gluten-free bun with a side salad.

3. **Grilled Chicken Sandwich** - Keep the avocado and fruit cup, but please note any additional charges for the addons.

Also, could you confirm if there are any additional charges for the gluten-free bun and avocado on the chicken sandwich, since I believe there is a small price adjustment? Thanks!",3173,4.805655

1. **Kids Chicken Tenders (2 orders)**: Each with ketchup, apple slices, and apple juice should be included in the description. 
2. **Classic Burger**: It should be confirmed as medium well with cheddar cheese, gluten-free bun, and a side salad. 
3. **Grilled Chicken Sandwich**: Needs avocado and a fruit cup as sides.

Could you please check if these details are correctly added? And, yes, my name is David, placing this order for my family.",2957,4.844892

2. **Kids Chicken Tenders Meal #2**: Need to confirm modifiers and drink.
3. **Classic Burger**: Looks good with medium-well, cheddar cheese, gluten-free bun, and side salad.
4. **Grilled Chicken Sandwich**: Needs the avocado and fruit cup adjusted for pricing.

Let me go through these and make sure everything matches up perfectly. Could you confirm these details again for me? It seems like the kids' meals and the chicken sandwich need a minor tweak.",3211,5.068539

It looks like the Grilled Chicken Sandwich price doesn't match up because it seems like there's an extra charge for the fruit cup. Can we confirm that the fruit cup is included as a standard side for the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with avocado? Plus, the Kids Chicken Tenders should be matching with what's listed under your menu as ""Kids Chicken Tenders"" rather than ""Kids Chicken Tenders Meal.""

Let's get these details ironed out so we're good to go!",3148,4.982482

1. The **Kids Chicken Tenders Meals** are good to go.
2. For the **Classic Burger**, I need it cooked medium well which wasn’t specified.
3. On the **Grilled Chicken Sandwich**, there's an extra $2.00 charge that shouldn't be there because the fruit cup should be free as one of the options, I believe.

Can we make sure these adjustments are in place? Once that's done, I'll be all set to finalize. Thanks!",3219,5.448947

1. I'm missing the second Kids Chicken Tenders Meal. I ordered two with the same modifiers—ketchup, apple slices, and apple juice.

2. **Classic Burger**: Already perfect with a medium well, cheddar cheese, on a gluten-free bun, and with a side salad.

3. **Grilled Chicken Sandwich**: Needs the avocado add-on, and while there’s a fruit cup, it seems there might be an extra charge, making it $19.49 instead of $17.49.
