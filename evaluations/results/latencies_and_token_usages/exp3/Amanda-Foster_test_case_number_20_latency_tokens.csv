0348564b-b198-451e-8ec2-8565fff77a51,Hi there! I'd like to place an order for our team lunch. Let me start with two Grilled Chicken Sandwiches. Can you make sure those come with French Fries as the side?,3503,3.264332
b341ee67-4a3f-4faa-8e37-b45299b1f3d0,"Hi, it's Amanda Foster. I'll stick with the grilled chicken sandwiches as they are—no need to add cheese or toppings. However, I do need to add to my order: two Club Sandwiches on wheat bread with potato chips as the side, and one Vegetable Stir Fry. Can you update that for me?",2252,4.539761
a0fe7dcb-43ff-4a86-8793-35b80b86f5c9,"Hey, it's Amanda Foster here. Let's keep the Vegetable Stir Fry as it is, without adding tofu or tempeh. For the spice level, make it mild, please. Could you also confirm the price for the entire order? Thanks!",2424,4.500339
17acf9cf-d8db-4616-b04b-aea68f47ddaa,"Hey there! Thanks for putting that together. There's just a tiny detail I'd like to adjust to make sure it matches what I wanted:

- The Club Sandwich should have ""Wheat"" as the bread choice, instead of ""Wheat Bread.""

Could you update that for me and confirm? I want to make sure everything's perfect. The total looks good, and I'll pick it up in about 20 minutes once confirmed!",2683,4.094693
28420726-7072-4d96-9cb5-289e297fd757,"It sounds like there's a slight issue to resolve. Can you make sure the Club Sandwiches have ""Wheat"" as the bread choice instead of any different variation, and ""Potato Chips"" for the side choice? 

Also, I need to confirm the total amount again. Could you assist me with that? Thanks for your help!",3601,4.442844
