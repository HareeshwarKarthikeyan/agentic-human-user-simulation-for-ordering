92703690-61af-4838-84aa-1fc8cb807995,"Hi! I'd like to place an order for some specific items. Can you please add the Atlantic Salmon, prepared grilled, to my order?",3481,3.461106
3830f770-abbf-455f-9ee8-222c63a98bc5,"Hi, this is Marcus James. Thanks for confirming the Atlantic Salmon with lemon butter sauce, rice pilaf, and asparagus. I'd like to add a Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a side salad and a large Fresh Orange Juice to my order, please.",2208,3.566749
0eb41a61-c4eb-42e8-ab92-5c7453a153d0,"Hey, yes that's mostly correct. But I do need to clarify a few things to match my requirements:

1. The **Atlantic Salmon** should be grilled, but ensure it's only with the grilled preparation, and we'd need to check on the protein content if possible. I do not need the rice pilaf, so if that could be removed, great.

2. The **Grilled Chicken Sandwich** is fine with a side salad.

3. And I'm looking for a **Large Fresh Orange Juice**. I noticed you listed it as ""Fresh Orange Juice"" and want to verify it's indeed the large size.

Could you confirm these details for me? Also, could you check the prices for each item? Thanks!",2523,4.03281
e72c6309-b94d-45d1-a6c1-0ffd679006db,"Alright, let's make sure everything is spot on.

- For the **Atlantic Salmon**, could you ensure it's grilled? 
- The **Grilled Chicken Sandwich** looks good with the side salad.
- The **Large Fresh Orange Juice** is perfect.

Once these adjustments are confirmed, I'm all set. Thanks!",3658,3.686507
4b4e1da8-eb09-4356-92b4-3903542e5ff8,"No, thanks! I'll stick with just those. Can you confirm that my order of the Atlantic Salmon grilled, Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a side salad, and a Large Fresh Orange Juice has been fully placed? Thanks!",2408,4.491509
41e738ab-3488-48a2-8bc5-0eb9306f3ee8,"Hey, looks like there's a bit of mix-up with my order. I need to make sure we get everything just right. I'm looking for:

1. **Atlantic Salmon** - Grilled, without rice pilaf.
2. **Grilled Chicken Sandwich** - With a side salad.
3. **Large Fresh Orange Juice**.

Could we adjust that so all the items are in place? Thanks!",3420,3.996011

38c4cfa8-1b78-4711-b872-f92d5be6cd89,"It looks like the items are almost right, but there's a slight mismatch on the juice. Can you make sure it's a large Fresh Orange Juice? Also, could you confirm the Atlantic Salmon's preparation as grilled only, without rice pilaf?

Thanks a lot!",2238,2.549813
20649978-bf20-420c-b6fb-43881c071345,"Hey, looks like we need to make a few adjustments to match what I intended to order. 

For the Atlantic Salmon, it needs to be grilled. 

For the Fresh Orange Juice, I want to confirm it's a large size at $5.99, not just an additional size modifier. 

Could you double-check those details for me? Thanks!",2429,3.760421
33ae5f92-74bc-4952-bcdf-3f20357b6ab6,"Hey, thanks for the confirmation! I do have a couple of things we need to tweak:

1. The **Atlantic Salmon** should be grilled, no rice pilaf - exactly as mentioned, so that sounds perfect, but just to confirm, is the pricing correctly adjusted to **$26.99**?

2. The **Grilled Chicken Sandwich** should come with a side salad. Just making sure that's set and the price for that is **$14.99**.

3. Could we check the price for the **Large Fresh Orange Juice**? I believe with the large size, it should come out to **$7.99**.

If these adjustments are made, we are all set. Could you confirm those details? Thanks!",2513,3.884124
8dcc091e-1423-4798-9a57-23078983efd6,"Hey, just to clarify before we wrap up, I've noticed a couple of details about my order:

1. I ordered the **Atlantic Salmon**, but it should be ""Grilled"" rather than ""Grilled Only."" The price is correct at **$26.99**.
2. For the **Grilled Chicken Sandwich**, the side should be listed with the option ""Side Salad,"" which is part of the target order.
3. I ordered the **Orange Juice** just as ""Fresh Orange Juice,"" but the pricing and size match the ""Large Fresh Orange Juice"" at **$7.99**.

Could you confirm these adjustments and let me know if everything aligns so I can keep track of my nutrition properly? Appreciate the help!",2630,3.613648

1. **Atlantic Salmon**, grilled.
2. **Grilled Chicken Sandwich** with a side salad.
3. **Large Fresh Orange Juice**.

It looks like there's just the Grilled Chicken Sandwich recorded at the moment. Can you add the other items so the order matches up? Thanks!",2418,3.179299

It looks like the Atlantic Salmon needs to be specifically grilled, and I also need a side salad with my Grilled Chicken Sandwich. For the Fresh Orange Juice, that's the large size, right?

Can you confirm those tweaks for me? Thanks a bunch!",2581,4.193832
31e102e4-a549-40fd-ad3e-207d3263ee36,"It looks like we need to make a couple of updates to the order:

1. For the **Atlantic Salmon**, can you make sure it's grilled? That's a specific prep request I had.
2. For the **Fresh Orange Juice**, it should be a large size. I see it's listed as ""Large Fresh Orange Juice,"" but just wanted to confirm that's the correct size.
3. And about the prices, the orange juice should add up to $7.99 with the large size modifier.

Could you please update that and confirm when it’s done? Thanks!",4063,7.438149
d9fc3a15-9449-4cb0-b51a-cd1fef1723ed,"Hey, thanks for confirming most of it, but could we make a couple of tweaks? I wanted to make sure the Atlantic Salmon is grilled, and the juice should be a ""Fresh Orange Juice,"" not ""Large Fresh Orange Juice,"" but in a large size, if that makes sense.

948c6619-14ef-4919-9baf-b2f5243ac840,"Hi there, it's Marcus James. Thanks for the breakdown! Looks like everything's almost set for my order. Just noticed a couple of points:

1. **Atlantic Salmon**: My bad, I forgot to mention it needs to be grilled. That's all good.
   
2. **Grilled Chicken Sandwich**: Just to double-check, the side salad should be included, right?

3. **Fresh Orange Juice**: Large size is perfect, but just checking if it's priced at $7.99 with the modifier.

It seems that everything’s pretty much good now after those tweaks. Could you confirm these specifics, just so we're clear on the details? Thanks!",2569,3.682118

Here's what I need in my order:

1. **Atlantic Salmon** - grilled.
2. **Grilled Chicken Sandwich** - with a side salad (already included, great!).
3. **Fresh Orange Juice** - large size.

Could you please add the Atlantic Salmon and the Fresh Orange Juice to that? Thanks!",2392,2.868844
