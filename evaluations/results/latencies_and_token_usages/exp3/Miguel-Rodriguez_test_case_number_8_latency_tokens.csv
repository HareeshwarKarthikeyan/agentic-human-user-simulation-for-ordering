d118c5a7-675a-4a62-b6f3-2d7706f0886a,"Hey! Yeah, that's the pizza I want. But I’d like to add a couple more things to my order. Can I get a double order of Buffalo Wings with Honey Garlic sauce and Blue Cheese dipping sauce? Oh, and a pitcher of Draft Beer too. Thanks!",2517,4.351721

25ab64f6-d9e1-4f98-baa8-4d84719c2799,"It seems like there are a couple of details to adjust in the order to make it exactly right. Could you please help update the following?

1. **Margherita Pizza:**
   - The crust should be ""Thick Crust"".
   - The price details for toppings: Italian Sausage should be $2.5 and Thick Crust should be $2.0 as listed.

2. **Pitcher of Draft Beer:**
   - The base price should be $6.99 with an additional $12.00 for the pitcher size, totaling $18.99.

Can we get that updated to match the target, please? Once corrected, I think we'll be all set to confirm.",2990,5.967454
99934c18-6ecc-4928-8bb1-63b9730d9624,"Hey there, it's Miguel Rodriguez. I'm looking at the items for my order here and I noticed a few things:  

- The Margherita Pizza should have a Size modifier ""Large 18"" at $16.99 for the base, but it's missing that price update which should include a $8.0 modifier.  
- The Buffalo Wings need a Sauce Choice ""Honey Garlic"" and a Dipping Sauce ""Blue Cheese"" to be added as modifiers.  

Could you adjust those for me? I want to make sure everything's just right! ",3047,4.794296
2674d7c5-aae3-45fe-81f0-e89b2ea60cf7,"Hey! It looks like there might have been a slight mix-up with the pizza order. Let me adjust it to make sure it matches what I'm after:

- **Margherita Pizza**:
  - Correct Size: Large 18"" (I need the size modifier to be explicitly mentioned, and it seems like there's an extra charge missing for that)
  - Addition: Mushrooms for $2.00
  - Total should actually be $31.49 for the pizza

Could you please update the order to reflect these modifications? Thanks so much for helping out!",3210,4.842287
0e0e4844-4553-48a0-bde1-6367e2dcf989,"Hey, it's Miguel Rodriguez here! Thanks for the detailed breakdown of the order. Let me make sure everything matches up. 

Here's what I need for the pizza: 
- **Large 18"" Margherita Pizza** with:
   - Thick Crust
   - Extra Toppings: Italian Sausage and Mushrooms

I noticed the Size option and pricing might need an update to match my target order. Just want to confirm that everything aligns.

Also, can you please make sure the wings are:
- **Buffalo Wings** with:
   - Honey Garlic Sauce
   - Blue Cheese Dipping Sauce
   - Double Order 

And for the drink:
- **Draft Beer**:
   - Make it a Pitcher, please.

Can you confirm these details and let me know about the total and pickup time? Thanks a bunch!",3030,4.43246

91f377c9-0213-43de-8939-478c0cbe22de,"Hey, thanks for that! Actually, I noticed a little hiccup. We need to make sure all the items match what I initially wanted to order. Can we tweak a few things?

1. For that Margherita Pizza, I need it to be with a thick crust and add the extra toppings of both Italian Sausage and Mushrooms, just like you quoted. Also, let's make sure it's priced at $31.49 the way I wanted.
   
2. For the wings, can you confirm they are labeled as ""Buffalo Wings"" with the double order portion size already mentioned? The pricing you mentioned sounds right!
   
3. And for that pitcher of beer, it's all good!

Looks like we're almost there, but let's make sure we get it all right before confirming. What's the adjusted total now with those correct tweaks?",2934,4.506299

For the **Margherita Pizza**, it should be a Large 18"" with:
- **Size Price Addition**: $8.00
- **Thick Crust**: $2.00
- **Extra Toppings**: Italian Sausage ($2.50), Mushrooms ($2.00)

- **Double Order Portion**: $10.00
- **Sauce Choice**: Honey Garlic
- **Dipping Sauce**: Blue Cheese
- Total for Wings should already be $23.99

The rest for the **Pitcher of Draft Beer** looks spot on at $18.99.

Would you be able to adjust those details for the pizza and wings so they match exactly? Thanks so much for understanding!",3120,4.620571
