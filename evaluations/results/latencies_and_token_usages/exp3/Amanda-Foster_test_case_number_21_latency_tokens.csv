1677ddcb-07be-40f0-aaa6-daf107684a36,"Hey there! Yep, that's correct, I've got two Large 18"" Margherita Pizzas and three Caesar Salads on my list. Let's go with the thin crust for the pizzas as it comes standard. No need to add any protein to the salads either—keeping it simple!

Could you confirm the total price for me, please?",2309,4.363639
e60e6a9c-b362-472f-afcd-7cac15702cd1,"Hi, it's Amanda Foster. Thanks for confirming the order details, but I noticed something with the pricing. The Margherita Pizzas should be Large 18"" which should be priced differently because of the size. Can we adjust that, so I am charged correctly for the Large 18"" pizzas with thin crust? Also, I don't need anything else besides the two pizzas and the three salads.",2409,3.106144
f2ac81c2-8639-4cc7-977a-8150d81657e6,"Alright, thanks for catching that. I’m Amanda Foster, and it looks like there’s a little mix-up with the Margherita Pizzas on the order. Each should be a Large 18"" for $16.99 plus the required size modifier of $8.00 each. That should make it $24.99 per pizza.

So to get it straight, let’s fix the pizza order details:
- 2 Large 18"" Margherita Pizzas at $24.99 each (including the $8.00 size modifier)

The total should then be:
- 2 x $24.99 = $49.98 (for the pizzas)
- Plus $38.97 (for the Caesar salads)

That brings the correct total to **$88.95**.

Please confirm or correct this, thanks!",2502,2.754196
