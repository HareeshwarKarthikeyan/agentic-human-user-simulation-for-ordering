620f2c41-aa6a-48f2-89a3-a4c6c65fb797,"Hi there! I'm Rachel, and I'm going to need a little help with my order today. I have two specific items in mind. 

First, I'd love to get the Chicken Parmesan, but could you make sure it's served with Angel Hair pasta and can I get some extra cheese on top? 

Alongside that, I'd like a bottle of House Red Wine. 

Could you make that happen for me? And, if you could describe how the Chicken Parmesan is typically plated, that would be fantastic!",3460,3.713483
896c18d3-1b2b-477a-b709-258e24cc9c75,"Hi there! Yes, you've got it right. Chicken Parmesan with Angel Hair pasta and extra cheese, and the House Red Wine. No need for anything else with that. Thanks for the wonderful service!",2369,4.219043
8404c9a7-3744-441e-b901-28ef73ae95be,"Hey, thanks for confirming! Actually, I go by the name Rachel Green. It looks like we're almost there with the order, but I wanted to check on one thing — the wine price. I was expecting the House Red Wine bottle to total up to $32.99, not $24.00. Could we just verify that quickly? Thanks a lot!",2430,4.079419
4b65e17c-f605-49ca-9bbd-aa32b18122b1,"Hey, it's Rachel Green. Thanks for checking the price for me. It looks like there might be a mistake in the total. The bottle of House Red Wine should be counted as $32.99, making the total a bit different. Could you adjust that for me? 

Also, once that's sorted, could you reconfirm the total cost? Thanks!",2364,1.751356
83153468-cbf9-49a6-b86c-5ad1b2ec20ac,"Could we adjust the order? For the Chicken Parmesan, can you make sure it comes with Angel Hair pasta along with the extra cheese? Also, the House Red Wine should be a bottle priced at $24.00, not $8.99 with additional pricing modifiers. Thanks for helping sort this out!",2435,4.743705
25b5a393-61a2-4ca4-975a-7be42f2abf64,"Hey! Just a quick note. I noticed the prices are a bit off compared to what I was expecting. Can we check on the wine price? It should show that the bottle is included in a specific pour size arrangement. So, just to clarify, I expected the wine's portion of the total to be $32.99, not $24. Could you confirm that, or do we need to make an adjustment?

And oh, this is for Rachel Green. As a little finishing touch, can you make sure everything's looking food-blogger photo-ready? Thanks!",2416,2.788843
b0343576-8dc5-45db-b816-fc5092dd0bfc,"Thanks for confirming that, but it looks like there's been a bit of a mix-up with my order. It seems like the House Red Wine should actually be priced at $32.99 as per my target order when it comes in a bottle, rather than $24.00. Maybe there was a different size or option selected by mistake? 

Also, could you please update the Chicken Parmesan to include ""Angel Hair"" for the pasta choice and the ""Extra Cheese"" as an extra, which should together make it $25.99? 

Could you make those adjustments for me? Thanks!",2513,2.233009
eb40608d-bfa9-4eba-83b6-f98c3b3637ce,"Oh, I see there's a little mix up! So here's what I'm aiming to get:

1. **Chicken Parmesan** with:
   - **Angel Hair pasta**
   - **Extra cheese**

2. **House Red Wine** that should be a bottle.

Let me double-check on that wine price — I think it should actually total **$32.99** for the bottle option. Could you confirm that again to make sure everything's aligned? Thanks for your patience!",2551,3.401547

ea0fcb7a-8fc9-4c6c-a0d8-0d8788c8b3ad,"Ah, I see where the misunderstanding might be. Let's get the order on track. I noticed a few discrepancies in the confirmation:

1. The **Chicken Parmesan** with Angel Hair pasta and extra cheese looks great. But just to confirm, the base price here seems adjusted. Could we ensure the extra cheese is added as a modifier with the additional charge of $3.00, to match the target pricing of **$25.99**?

2. For the **House Red Wine**, there seems to be some confusion over the base price. My order actually targets a bottle priced at **$32.99**. Can we adjust that to reflect the pour size accurately?

Could we get those sorted out? Thanks so much!",2608,4.242156

Could you please go ahead and add that to my order? I'll only need the one bottle. Thanks!",2447,4.736414

1. Chicken Parmesan: I remember the price being $22.99 and with extra cheese, it comes to $25.99, which is correct.
2. House Red Wine: The base price was $8.99 with an additional $24.00 for the bottle, making it $32.99.

So, yes the total of $58.98 sounds good; let's go ahead with it! Please proceed with the order under the name Rachel Green for pickup. Thanks!",2407,3.079938
