a882966d-ae0b-4da6-b645-8ed8681623df,"Hi! I'm Marcus. I'm looking to place an order, and I've got some particular things in mind. Could you tell me what kind of burgers you have? I'm curious about the protein content and any options for low carb substitutes like lettuce wraps instead of buns.",2305,3.489993
15963c02-8e32-4e82-8721-90b6ffdd8538,"Hey, thanks for letting me know! I'm interested in ordering two of the Classic Burgers, and I'd like them with lettuce wraps instead of buns. Can you make those medium, please? Also, could you let me know if there's a side salad option?",2682,3.124705
e9a2e02b-1062-4bf1-b924-5dc2ade780a1,"No cheese or additional toppings for the burgers, thanks! And just to be sure, do you have the nutritional information for the Classic Burger, like the protein content?",4116,3.631161
fc0c10bb-9bfb-4706-81a4-9c1666d283f7,"I think I'm good without drinks for now. Could you also add a Vegetable Stir Fry with cauliflower rice to my order, please?",2791,2.968977

08bf26d6-daac-492d-9574-a912bc59a97c,"Actually, it's Marcus James for the order. Also, I noticed there might be a small mistake. It seems like the total should be $49.97, given the cauliflower rice for the stir fry might have a cost associated with it. Could you double-check that for me? Thanks!",3062,1.774537
efc85ba1-132f-4b57-849f-f5a29355e929,"It seems there might have been a small oversight, as the cauliflower rice was priced separately in my original target order at $3 extra. The order total should actually be $49.97, not $46.97. Could you please verify that the $3 extra for the cauliflower rice in the Vegetable Stir Fry is included, bringing the total to $49.97? Thanks!",3176,1.419789
e9607f1d-6592-4a9a-8f31-23fdcc961648,"Hey, sorry if I seem a bit confused, but I was really under the impression that the cauliflower rice would add $3 to the order total. It's important for me to stick to the price I planned for my macros. Could we make sure this clarification is correct, or if there's any chance it was missed? I'd like the total to be $49.97 as I originally calculated.",3602,3.190965
