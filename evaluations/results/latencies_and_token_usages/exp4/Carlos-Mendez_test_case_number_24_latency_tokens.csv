810ec436-0785-45f0-96ce-435e4c20768a,"I'd love to go with the Atlantic Salmon but could I have it blackened instead? And could we swap out the lemon butter sauce for a mango salsa? Oh, and if it's possible, I'd like to replace the rice pilaf with quinoa. Thanks!",3756,3.491421
208cbbcb-a0d4-4d39-855b-183447b49b09,"Actually, I'm all set on drinks, but I'm thinking about getting an appetizer to go along with it. Can you tell me a bit about your Spinach Artichoke Dip and what kind of bread comes with it?",3918,3.364169
d7c82442-378d-4bf7-b7b2-ff9e71ae265f,"Oh, that sounds delicious! Could you add the pita bread to the Spinach Artichoke Dip, please? I'm really interested in seeing how it pairs with the pita. Thanks!",2650,2.914457
f5e1ff96-d17f-412e-afb2-7638cbad61a0,"Nope, that's perfect, thanks! The name for the order is Carlos Mendez. Can you confirm the total price for me?",2325,2.958103

c92747a7-3ed5-4434-b632-fa4e40d030ab,"I'm a bit confused here. I ordered the Atlantic Salmon with it being blackened and with mango salsa, along with quinoa instead of rice pilaf. Shouldn't the items like mango salsa and quinoa have some prices added to the total? Could you please double-check that for me?",3185,4.499162
54ab567e-10ae-4b6f-a35d-b5b530ecaab4,"It seems like there might still be a misunderstanding about the prices. The Atlantic Salmon with the mango salsa and quinoa should have an additional cost. The updated breakdown should be:

- Atlantic Salmon, blackened with mango salsa and quinoa: $31.99
- Spinach Artichoke Dip with pita bread: $13.99

This brings the total to $45.98. Let's stick with that, and could you confirm this updated total before we finalize the order for pickup? Thank you!",3392,3.804218
