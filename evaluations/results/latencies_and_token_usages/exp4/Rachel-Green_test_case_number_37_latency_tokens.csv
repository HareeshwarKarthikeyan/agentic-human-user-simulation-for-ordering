d367be49-26e3-4036-bef7-a922be2a0265,Hi there! I'm really excited to try some of your dishes for a blog review. Could you tell me more about your lobster tail options? I'm especially interested in how they're prepared and any unique variations you might have.,2289,4.01558
e6a5ba34-2621-4cc0-8e24-8644465e3c9b,"That Lobster Tail sounds amazing! I’d love to try the broiled preparation, please. Could you also let me know if you have any unique or seasonal specials for today?",2508,2.866659
bd835673-4b30-498b-b4e7-c0ea36dab3f2,"Hi, it's Rachel Green. I'll stick with the single broiled Lobster Tail for now, no extra tail, thank you. And I'd also like to add a Chocolate Lava Cake with chocolate ice cream and whipped cream topping to the order. What's the total price for these items?",2549,1.076532
fe370882-98fa-4373-8887-7c55654fdcdd,"Oh, I'm a bit confused. Just to clarify, I wanted to make sure my order includes a Lobster Tail prepared broiled, with just one tail and no add-ons, and a Chocolate Lava Cake with chocolate ice cream and whipped cream topping. Can I get a confirmation on that, please?",4656,3.532258
defde686-6aa9-4ffe-956a-b9015d9ba1fb,"It looks like there's been a small mistake with the order details. I had asked for a triple Lobster Tail, prepared broiled, which includes a third tail add-on. Could you please update that? And yes, I'd love to confirm a pickup time after we make sure everything is correct. Thank you!",2149,0.651594
