3a0689d4-540e-49db-91f5-1f467e1139bb,Hi there! This is Sofia Russo. I'm a bit of a wine enthusiast and I'm looking forward to a nice dinner pairing. Could you tell me about your options for a Filet Mignon? I'm aiming for it to be cooked medium rare.,2239,3.269646
b9ba4649-505b-4059-8263-b3cabb3ec474,"Hey, thanks so much for the details! The Filet Mignon sounds fantastic. I think I'll go with the Red Wine Reduction sauce to complement the steak. As for sides, could you tell me a bit more about the truffle mac and cheese? Is it a substantial serving? Oh, and do you have any recommendations for a nice red wine to pair with the meal? I might consider a glass with my dinner.",2690,3.17233

Let's go for a 9oz glass of the House Red Wine to complete the meal, please. Could you tell me how much that would cost?",2888,3.248498
