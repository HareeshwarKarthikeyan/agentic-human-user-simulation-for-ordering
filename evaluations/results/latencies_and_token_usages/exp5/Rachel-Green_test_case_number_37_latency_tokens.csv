Could you tell me a bit more about the presentation or any unique details about how it's served? And, for my review, is there an option to add the third tail as an add-on?",2507,4.467054
35854fc0-153f-4f61-8dcf-2905eb12e922,"Oh, the presentation of the Lobster Tail sounds fantastic! I'm really curious about how the third tail option works with the plating. Can you describe what exactly it looks like when it's served with three tails? Also, how do the wild rice and seasonal vegetables complement the lobster's flavor?",2513,2.764771
d01f815f-21c6-45a6-8e8b-83e3765a8a4a,"Hi, it's Rachel Green here. That description sounds absolutely delicious! I’m really leaning towards starting with a single Lobster Tail, prepared broiled style. Could you tell me a bit more about how it's prepared? Any special spices or techniques you use that makes it a standout dish? Also, that third lobster tail option sounds intriguing, could you tell me about the price for that?",2679,3.014246
d0bc03e0-1fb8-4120-88af-8971df48ec38,Thanks for the details! It sounds delicious. I'm really interested in just one broiled Lobster Tail for now. Could you describe how the plating looks? I'm planning to take some photos for my blog.,3943,4.943972
6d787ced-20a3-497d-89f9-338509b92dfa,"Hmm, that Lobster Tail does sound mouthwatering! But could I actually add a third tail to that? And then, I'm also thinking about having the Chocolate Lava Cake. I’d like it with chocolate ice cream and some whipped cream on top. How does that sound?

Oh, and out of curiosity, could you tell me more about the ingredients or presentation of the dessert?",2664,3.68266

Also, don’t forget to add the whipped cream for the extra creaminess, and ensure the presentation photos are perfect for the review! Here’s my phone number: [Your Phone Number]. 

Thanks again!",2907,4.5523
