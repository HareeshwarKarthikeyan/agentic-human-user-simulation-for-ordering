f8a1cd4d-1527-4a37-93d5-b7c868fd774e,"Oh, that sounds wonderful! I'd love to order the Filet Mignon, cooked Medium Rare, and could you add the Hollandaise sauce to it? I'm really particular about how it's plated since I need those perfect shots for my food blog. Anything special in presentation that comes with the Filet Mignon?",2556,2.660082
c42d72c3-3ee5-469b-bf43-1a8c4c70d73c,"Thanks for confirming the Filet Mignon with the Hollandaise sauce! It sounds amazing. I'm also interested in trying the New York Cheesecake. Could you tell me a bit about its presentation? Does it come with any toppings, like strawberries or maybe some chocolate sauce?

Also, what drinks would pair well with this meal?",2572,3.522587
31f39a57-3dc4-458d-b270-80ba5bb9d19b,"Oh, that New York Cheesecake sounds delightful! I'd love to add one of those to my order with a strawberry topping, please. How's the berry compote made? Any unique twists to it?",2621,3.171202

Now, about the drink, I would love to dive into the details! Could you tell me a bit more about the house red wine you offer?",2538,3.680239

Also, I noticed that in my order I had requested a New York Cheesecake with chocolate sauce, but I'd actually need it with both chocolate and strawberry toppings. Could you update that for me, please?

And for the Filet Mignon, just to confirm, it should be with Hollandaise sauce, even if it's not required. Could you let me know if there's an extra cost for that?",2838,3.645994

I'm really curious, though, could you tell me a bit more about how the Cabernet Sauvignon is paired with the steak? I'm always interested in understanding these flavor profiles better, especially for my blog. 

Oh, and by the way, no wine for this order. Let's keep it cozy with just the meal and dessert. Thanks!",2844,5.649279
