Could you help me out with that? I'm looking to order a Classic Burger, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, and two Fresh Orange Juices.",2408,5.831845
696fd4b5-21ad-470f-aa4d-00c81a05d40b,"Alright, let's start with the Classic Burger. Could you please make it well done, with American cheese, and for the side, I'd like to go with French Fries. Also, could you tell me a bit about how kid-friendly the portion sizes are for the burgers?",2617,3.027535

And for the Fresh Orange Juices, let's have both in small sizes.

Can you let me know if that works and give me the total cost of the order?",2666,3.892505

And it seems like the orange juices are called ""Fresh Orange Juice,"" so let's make sure that's all squared away too. 

The name for the order is Frank Morrison.

Oh, and are these options kid-friendly enough? My grandkids aren't heavy eaters, so I want to make sure these portions are suitable for them.",2929,4.402976
