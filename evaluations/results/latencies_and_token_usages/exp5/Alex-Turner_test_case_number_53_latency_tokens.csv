16f482a6-2d5e-4b4c-af96-b1492fc66d6e,"Hey there! I'm interested in your Portobello Mushroom Burger. Can you tell me if it's vegan, and if there’s an option to add vegan cheese to it? Oh, and does it come with a side of sweet potato fries?",2273,4.518827
fe416f20-e21b-4d7e-b2ea-e3bcaddff1e0,"Yeah, I'd like the vegan cheese on the Portobello Mushroom Burger, please. And sweet potato fries as the side sounds great too! Could you also let me know if there's any cross-contamination with animal products when preparing the vegan options?",2406,2.527881
0e536472-dbf2-4853-aedf-e35e68e4e4f4,The name for the order is Alex Turner. Thanks for taking note of the preparation details for vegans. Is there anything else you need from me before we finalize?,3800,6.793589
7ebdcd0b-749b-4487-9d8b-2e99a10c084c,"No thanks, I'm all set without a drink! Just to make sure everything's good, could you confirm there's no cross-contamination with animal products for the vegan cheese and sweet potato fries? Thanks!",2436,5.578314
05188bbf-623e-44e8-a4a0-32477d3ef4b3,I'm a bit confused because I actually wanted the vegan cheese and the sweet potato fries to be included in the burger. Could you please adjust it so that the Portobello Mushroom Burger comes with the vegan cheese and includes sweet potato fries as a side option with the burger itself? Thanks!,3775,6.809666
beac4950-4130-4b99-bfe7-cfb73637ad90,"Actually, I believe there's a slight discrepancy. The total for the Portobello Mushroom Burger with vegan cheese and sweet potato fries is $18.49, not $16.49. Can we have that corrected, please? Also, you can go ahead and finalize that order for me. My name is Alex.",2506,3.979969
