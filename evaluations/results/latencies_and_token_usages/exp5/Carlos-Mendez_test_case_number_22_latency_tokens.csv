cd112e49-f39d-436c-9557-fff2c64976c6,"Great, I’d love to go with the Filet Mignon, please. I'd like it cooked to **Rare** and with the **Red Wine Reduction** sauce. Could you also tell me about any interesting add-ons for this dish?",2552,2.792239
5ea04c74-8fe8-40ec-9ad9-e365eb38715a,"Oh, I think I'd like to add the Blue Cheese Crust to the Filet Mignon. That should bring out a rich contrast with the Red Wine Reduction. 

And can you also add a Lobster Tail, prepared grilled with a bit of extra butter? I'm curious how the flavors mingle!

What's the price for this so far?",2697,4.741878

As for adding anything else, nah, I think I'm good with what I have right now. Could you just confirm that everything is set for my current order?",4472,6.449258
