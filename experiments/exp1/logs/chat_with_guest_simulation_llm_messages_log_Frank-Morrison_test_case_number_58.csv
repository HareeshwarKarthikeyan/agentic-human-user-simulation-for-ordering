Now, for the Fish and Chips, do you have a preference for the type of fish? We have haddock for an additional $2 or halibut for an additional $4. Which would you like?",order_taking_llm,2025-08-30T05:37:53.604667+00:00,,,,,,-1.0

So we have the 2 Kids Chicken Tenders meals, 1 Kids Mac and Cheese, and 1 Fish and Chips. Can you get me the total, please?",guest_simulation_llm,2025-08-30T05:37:54.884159+00:00,,,,,"{""num_requests"": 1, ""num_request_tokens"": 1473, ""num_response_tokens"": 54, ""total_tokens"": 1527}",1278.3770561218262
284d7041-583f-435e-af39-4a61b9f55495,assistant,"Sure! Let me quickly calculate that for you:

- 2 Kids Chicken Tenders meals ($8.99 each) = $17.98
- 1 Kids Mac and Cheese ($7.99) = $7.99
- 1 Fish and Chips ($18.99) = $18.99

Now, let’s add that all up:
- $17.98 (chicken tenders) + $7.99 (mac and cheese) + $18.99 (fish and chips) = $44.96.

So, your total comes to **$44.96**. 

Can I get your name for the order?",order_taking_llm,2025-08-30T05:37:57.470916+00:00,,,,,,-1.0
