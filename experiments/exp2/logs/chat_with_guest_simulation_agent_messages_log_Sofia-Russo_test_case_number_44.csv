Welcome to The Garden Bistro. How can I help you today?\nagent: Hi there! I'm Sofia. I'm looking to order an Atlantic Salmon and a Caesar Salad. Could you tell me if you have a wine recommendation that pairs well with salmon? I usually like my salad dressing on the side, if that's possible.\nassistant: Hi Sofia! Great choices! For the Atlantic Salmon, it pairs really well with a nice white wine, like our House White Wine. It complements the flavors beautifully. \n\nNow, for your order, I noted that you’d like the salad dressing on the side. Would you like to add a protein to your Caesar Salad, like grilled chicken, shrimp, or salmon? And how would you like your salmon prepared — grilled, blackened, or do you prefer it another way? \n\nLet me know, and I’ll get that all set for you!\nagent: Hi! I'd like to have the Atlantic Salmon grilled, please. As for the Caesar Salad, I'm keeping it simple without any added protein for today. That House White Wine sounds perfect to pair with the salmon. Let's go ahead with that. Thanks!\nassistant: Alright, Sofia! Just to confirm, you’d like:\n\n- **1 Atlantic Salmon**, grilled\n- **1 Caesar Salad** with dressing on the side and no protein\n- **1 House White Wine**\n\nLet me calculate that for you:\n\n- Atlantic Salmon: $26.99\n- Caesar Salad: $12.99\n- House White Wine: $8.99\n\nThat brings your total to **$48.97**. \n\nCould I have a name for the order, please? And just to confirm, it will be for pickup. Your order will be ready in about 20 minutes!\nagent: It seems the total price calculated earlier is a little different from my initial target order pricing. Just to be sure we're good on everything, let's run through it again. The name should still be Sofia Russo. I'm ready for pickup in about 20 minutes. Thanks!\nassistant: Thanks for that, Sofia Russo! Just to make sure we're all set:\n\n- **1 Atlantic Salmon**, grilled\n- **1 Caesar Salad** with dressing on the side and no protein\n- **1 House White Wine**\n\nThat brings your total to **$48.97** just as confirmed! \n\nYour order will be ready for pickup in about 20 minutes. Thank you for choosing The Garden Bistro! We appreciate your order and look forward to seeing you soon!\nagent: It looks like there was a misunderstanding with the initial target order on the total price for the items. Could we go over the individual prices again to ensure everything's good? My target order originally comes to a total of $39.98. Can we double-check and match it to that total? Thank you!\nassistant: Oh, I appreciate your patience, Sofia! Let’s break down the prices one more time:\n\n- **Atlantic Salmon**: $26.99\n- **Caesar Salad**: $12.99\n- **House White Wine**: $8.99\n\nSo, adding those together:\n- $26.99 + $12.99 + $8.99 = **$48.97**\n\nIt looks like the initial total of **$48.97** is accurate. If you’d like to adjust your order to meet a different total, I can certainly help with that! Just let me know what you'd like to change. Thank you!\nagent: Hi there! It seems like the target order includes the Atlantic Salmon and Caesar Salad, and the total for those should actually be $39.98. However, if we're including the House White Wine, the calculated total does indeed come to $48.97. If we're sticking to the original, it should just be the salmon, salad with dressing on the side, and no wine. \n\nCould you confirm if the wine is to be included, or if you'd prefer the target total? Thanks!\nassistant: I totally understand now, Sofia! So, just to confirm, you’d like:\n\n- **1 Atlantic Salmon**, grilled\n- **1 Caesar Salad** with dressing on the side and no protein\n- No House White Wine to keep your total at **$39.98**.\n\nLet me recalculate without the wine:\n\n- Atlantic Salmon: $26.99\n- Caesar Salad: $12.99 \n- Total: **$39.98**\n\nIs that correct?
