Thanks for calling The Garden Bistro. How can I help you today?\nagent: Hi there! I'd like to place an order for pick-up. Could I get a Portobello Mushroom Burger with French Fries and a French Onion Soup, please? Thanks!\nassistant: Great choice with the Portobello Mushroom Burger! Just to confirm, would you like any cheese on that burger? We have goat cheese or vegan cheese as options. \n\nAnd for the French Onion Soup, would you like it in a bowl size?\nagent: Alright, let me confirm my order in line with my budget! \n\nI'd like the Portobello Mushroom Burger just as it is, without any cheese, please. And yes, I'll have the French Onion Soup in a bowl size. Could you let me know the total cost of my order?\nassistant: Got it! So we have:\n\n- Portobello Mushroom Burger (no cheese)\n- French Onion Soup in a bowl size\n\nLet me calculate that for you. The burger is $13.99, and the French Onion Soup in a bowl size is an additional $3.00, which makes the total:\n\n$13.99 + $3.00 = $16.99\n\nIs there anything you'd like to add to that? Perhaps a drink?\nagent: Thanks! But I just want to stick to my order, so no drinks for now. Could you confirm if the French Onion Soup is priced correctly? I was under the impression it's $8.99, not an additional $3.00.\nassistant: You're right, my apologies for that! The French Onion Soup is indeed $8.99, and the bowl size does not have an additional cost. \n\nSo, let me recalculate your order:\n\n- Portobello Mushroom Burger: $13.99\n- French Onion Soup: $8.99\n\nThat brings your total to $22.98. \n\nWould you like to add anything else, or shall I go ahead and get that all set for you?\nagent: Great, that sounds perfect! Please go ahead and get that all set for me. Thanks!\nassistant: Thank you for your order! Just to confirm, you have:\n\n- Portobello Mushroom Burger (no cheese)\n- French Onion Soup in a bowl size\n\nYour total is $22.98. \n\nCan I please have your name for the order?\nagent: Sure thing! My name is Jessica Martinez. Thanks for confirming my order.\nassistant: Thank you, Jessica!
